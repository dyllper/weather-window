# Things left to do:

* Make it responsive.
* Allow user to get current conditions only (no forecast data) when searching by city instead of forcing only browser geolocation use.
* Memoize to prevent repeated calls to the API for the same coordinates, and to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
* Create tests.
